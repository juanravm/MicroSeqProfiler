# MicroSeqProfiler

## Description

*MicroSeqProfiler* package is a powerful tool for in-depth analysis and
exploration of microbiome data based on 16S ribosomal RNA marker genes. 
This package provides a complete and efficient solution for researchers to 
understand the composition and diversity of microbial communities present 
in different biological groups, by compiling a variety of previously 
developed.

With *MicroSeqProfiler*, you can perform comprehensive analyses of 16S RNA 
sequencing data, describing and quantifying the microbial species present
in your samples. You can obtain diversity metrics to determine the divergences 
in the species in the microbial community and their relative abundance between 
sample groups by using QIIME2 software (https://qiime2.org/).

Also, it performs LEfSe analysis to identify differentially abundant 
microorganisms between groups that can be associated with sample condition.
Finally, it uses PICRUSt2 software to infer in the metagenomic composition
of the microbial community and performs advanced differential abundance
methods to reveal microbial metabolic pathways disparities between samples.
